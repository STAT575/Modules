For each of these projects, state the title and write a paragraph summarizing the research question addressed in the writing project.

2. If you have already started working on your writing project, write a one paragraph summary of the research question you plan to investigate. Otherwise, list a few topics that you'd be interested in exploring for the writing project.

3. Write at least 2 faculty members you'd be interested in working with on the writing project.
